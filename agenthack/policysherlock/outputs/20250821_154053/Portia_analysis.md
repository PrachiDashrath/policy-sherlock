#### Potential Privacy Gaps

- **Data Collection Through Forms**: The form collects email addresses, which can be used to send marketing emails or other notifications without explicit consent.
  - **Solution**: Ensure that users are explicitly informed and have the option to opt out of receiving such communications. Also, implement strict privacy policies and obtain clear consent for data collection.

- **Cookies and Tracking**: Meta tags set cookies for Google Analytics and Reddit Pixel.
  - **Solution**: Implement a robust cookie management system to allow users to manage their cookies or delete them at any time. Educate users about the importance of controlling their online tracking practices.
